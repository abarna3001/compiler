#Folder forwhile-> Given a "for" loop with statement.First it was checked that in "for" loop.If it's in "for" loop format and that was converted into "while" loop.

#Folder syntaxtree->Take a arithmetic expression that was generate as a syntax tree and that was displayed in preorder.

#Folder threeaddress->create three address statement for arithmetic expression.

#Folder backbatching->Given a boolean expression with "if-else" statement and "if" statemet then create the truelist and false list for these statement.

#Folder CFG(control flow graph)->Given a set of c statement that generate three address statement and create basic block for that three address statement and generate control flow graph for that basic block.

#Folder ConstantPropagation->Generate dag for basic block and that removes the copy propagation, constant folding and common sub expression.and finally create a new basic blocks.

#Folder labeledtree->Given arithmetic expression that was generate as syntax tree in preorder and generate code for that arithmetic expression using syntax tree.
